    "One thing to wrap your head around (it may not be very intuitive for everyone at first) is that this Airflow Python script is really just a configuration file specifying the DAG’s structure as code. The actual tasks defined here will run in a different context from the context of this script. Different tasks run on different workers at different points in time, which means that this script cannot be used to cross communicate between tasks. Note that for this purpose we have a more advanced feature called XCom.\n",
    "\n",
    "People sometimes think of the DAG definition file as a place where they can do some actual data processing - that is not the case at all! The script’s purpose is to define a DAG object. It needs to evaluate quickly (seconds, not minutes) since the scheduler will execute it periodically to reflect the changes if any.\n",

This may be desirable for many reasons, like separating your script’s logic and pipeline code, allowing for proper code highlighting in files composed in different languages, and general flexibility in structuring pipelines. It is also possible to define your template_searchpath as pointing to any folder locations in the DAG constructor call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using that same DAG constructor call, it is possible to define user_defined_macros which allow you to specify your own variables. For example, passing dict(foo='bar') to this argument allows you to use {{ foo }} in your templates. Moreover, specifying user_defined_filters allow you to register you own filters. For example, passing dict(hello=lambda name: 'Hello %s' % name) to this argument allows you to use {{ 'world' | hello }} in your templates. For more information regarding custom filters have a look at the Jinja Documentation\n",
